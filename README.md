Quiz Application Readme <br /><br />
Welcome to the Quiz Application! This project aims to create an interactive quiz platform for candidates applying for specific positions. Below is an overview of the features and functionalities implemented in this application:

1-Homepage <br /><br />
Upon accessing the application, candidates will be greeted with a warm welcome message and a brief introduction to the position they are applying for. The homepage will also contain information about the quiz and the estimated time required to complete it.

2-User Registration and Login <br /><br />
Candidates cannot participate in the quiz without first registering and logging into the application. The registration form will include essential fields such as first name, last name, email, and a dropdown list of the available positions (JavaScript, CSS, HTML). After successful registration and login, the homepage will display a personalized message, addressing the candidate by their first name.

3-Quiz Start Button <br /><br />
The homepage will feature a prominent "Start Quiz" button. Candidates can begin the quiz only after logging in.

4-Countdown Timer <br /><br />
When the user starts the quiz, a countdown timer will be activated to display the remaining time. If the time runs out before the candidate completes the quiz, the test will automatically finish, and the candidate will be taken to the results page.

5- Quiz Format <br /><br />
The quiz will be presented in a sequential manner, showing one question at a time. All questions will be multiple-choice, and the user must select one option as their answer. Navigation to the next question will be restricted until the user selects an answer.

6- Submitting the Quiz <br /><br />
Upon reaching the last question, a "Submit" button will be displayed. Once the candidate clicks on this button, the quiz will be submitted for evaluation.

7- Results Page <br /><br />
After submitting the quiz, the candidate will be redirected to the results page. This page will display the pass or fail result, along with the number of correct and wrong answers. The total number of questions answered incorrectly will also be provided.

8- Pass/Fail Theme <br /><br />
If the candidate passes the quiz, the result page will be themed in green. In the event of failure, the page will have a red theme.

9- Show Answers <br /><br />
On the results page, candidates will find a "Show Answers" button. By clicking this button, they can view a table displaying all questions, their selected answers, and the correct answers. Correct answers will be highlighted in green, while incorrect answers will be marked in red.

10- Logout Functionality <br /><br />
Upon completing the quiz or anytime during the quiz, the candidate can log out of the application. Clicking the logout button will return them to the homepage.

We hope you find this Quiz Application user-friendly and beneficial for assessing candidates' knowledge and skills for various positions. Should you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.

Thank you for using the Quiz Application!
